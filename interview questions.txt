interview questions for Data Types, Operators, Conditional Statements, Looping Statements, Functions.

1)What is map function in Python?
Ans: map function executes the function given as the first argument on all the elements of the iterable given as the second argument. If the function given takes in more than 1 arguments, then many iterables are given. 

2)To open a file c:scores.txt for writing, we use?
a) outfile = open(“c:scores.txt”, “r”)
b) outfile = open(“c:scores.txt”, “w”)
c) outfile = open(file = “c:scores.txt”, “r”)
d) outfile = open(file = “c:scores.txt”, “o”)
Answer: b) The location contains double slashes ( ) and w is used to indicate that file is being written to.

3)What is the process of compilation and linking in python?
Ans: The compiling and linking allows the new extensions to be compiled properly without any error and the linking can be done only when it passes the compiled procedure. If the dynamic loading is used then it depends on the style that is being provided with the system. The python interpreter can be used to provide the dynamic loading of the configuration setup files and will rebuild the interpreter.

The steps that are required in this as:

Create a file with any name and in any language that is supported by the compiler of your system. For example file.c or file.cpp
Place this file in the Modules/ directory of the distribution which is getting used.
Add a line in the file Setup.local that is present in the Modules/ directory.
Run the file using spam file.o
After a successful run of this rebuild the interpreter by using the make command on the top-level directory.
If the file is changed then run rebuildMakefile by using the command as ‘make Makefile’.

4)What are Python libraries? Name a few of them.
Ans: Python libraries are a collection of Python packages. Some of the majorly used python libraries are – Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and many more.

5)Explain Inheritance in Python with an example.
Ans: Inheritance allows One class to gain all the members(say attributes and methods) of another class. Inheritance provides code reusability, makes it easier to create and maintain an application. The class from which we are inheriting is called super-class and the class that is inherited is called a derived / child class.

They are different types of inheritance supported by Python:

Single Inheritance – where a derived class acquires the members of a single super class.
Multi-level inheritance – a derived class d1 in inherited from base class base1, and d2 are inherited from base2.
Hierarchical inheritance – from one base class you can inherit any number of child classes
Multiple inheritance – a derived class is inherited from more than one base class.

6)How are classes created in Python? 
Ans: Class in Python is created using the class keyword.

Example:
class Employee:
   def __init__(self, name):
   self.name = name
   E1=Employee("abc")
   print(E1.name)
Output: abc

6)Does python support multiple inheritance?
Ans: Multiple inheritance means that a class can be derived from more than one parent classes. Python does support multiple inheritance, unlike Java.

7)How do you do data abstraction in Python?
Ans: Data Abstraction is providing only the required details and hiding the implementation from the world. It can be achieved in Python by using interfaces and abstract classes.

8) Write a program in Python to produce Star triangle.
Ans:
def pyfunc(r):
    for x in range(r):
        print(' '*(r-x-1)+'*'*(2*x+1))    
pyfunc(9)
Output: *
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********
   ***********
  *************
 ***************
*****************

9)Write a program in Python to check if a number is prime.
ans:
a=int(input("enter number"))
if a=1:
   for x in range(2,a):
         if(a%x)==0:
          print("not prime")
   break
   else:
      print("Prime")
else:
   print("not prime")
Output:

enter number 3
Prime

9)What is a dynamically typed language?
Ans: Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is. Typing refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a strongly-typed language, such as Python, "1" + 2 will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for "type-coercion" (implicit conversion of data types). On the other hand, a weakly-typed language, such as Javascript, will simply output "12" as result.

Type-checking can be done at two stages -

Static - Data Types are checked before execution.
Dynamic - Data Types are checked during execution.
Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.

10)What is PEP 8 and why is it important?
Ans: PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is an official design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes. PEP 8 is especially important since it documents the style guidelines for Python Code. Apparently contributing to the Python open-source community requires you to follow these style guidelines sincerely and strictly.

11)What are modules and packages in Python?
Ans: Python packages and Python modules are two mechanisms that allow for modular programming in Python. Modularizing has several advantages -

Simplicity: Working on a single module helps you focus on a relatively small portion of the problem at hand. This makes development easier and less error-prone.
Maintainability: Modules are designed to enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If they are written in a manner that reduces interdependency, it is less likely that modifications in a module might impact other parts of the program.
Reusability: Functions defined in a module can be easily reused by other parts of the application.
Scoping: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid confusion between identifiers from other parts of the program.
Modules, in general, are simply Python files with a .py extension and can have a set of functions, classes, or variables defined and implemented. They can be imported and initialized once using the import statement. If partial functionality is needed, import the requisite classes or functions using from foo import bar.

Packages allow for hierarchial structuring of the module namespace using dot notation. As, modules help avoid clashes between global variable names, in a similar manner, packages help avoid clashes between module names.
Creating a package is easy since it makes use of the system's inherent file structure. So just stuff the modules into a folder and there you have it, the folder name as the package name. Importing a module or its contents from this package requires the package name as prefix to the module name joined by a dot.

12)What is __init__?
Ans: __init__ is a contructor method in Python and is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/instance is created. All classes have a __init__ method associated with them. It helps in distinguishing methods and attributes of a class from local variables.

# class definition
class Student:
   def __init__(self, fname, lname, age, section):
       self.firstname = fname
       self.lastname = lname
       self.age = age
       self.section = section
# creating a new object
stu1 = Student("Sara", "Ansh", 22, "A2")

13)What is break, continue and pass in Python?
Ans: Break	The break statement terminates the loop immediately and the control flows to the statement after the body of the loop.
Continue	The continue statement terminates the current iteration of the statement, skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and the control flows to the next iteration of the loop.
Pass	As explained above, the pass keyword in Python is generally used to fill up empty blocks and is similar to an empty statement represented by a semi-colon in languages such as Java, C++, Javascript, etc.
pat = [1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3]
for p in pat:
   pass
   if (p == 0):
       current = p
       break
   elif (p % 2 == 0):
       continue
   print(p)    # output => 1 3 1 3 1
print(current)

Output --> 0

14) What is docstring in Python?
Ans: Documentation string or docstring is a multiline string used to document a specific code segment.
The docstring should describe what the function or method does.

15) What is the difference between Python Arrays and lists?
Ans: Arrays in python can only contain elements of same data types i.e., data type of array should be homogeneous. It is a thin wrapper around C language arrays and consumes far less memory than lists.
Lists in python can contain elements of different data types i.e., data type of lists can be heterogeneous. It has the disadvantage of consuming large memory.
import array
a = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3])
for i in a:
    print(i, end=' ')    #OUTPUT: 1 2 3
a = array.array('i', [1, 2, 'string'])    #OUTPUT: TypeError: an integer is required (got type str)
a = [1, 2, 'string']
for i in a:
   print(i, end=' ')  
Output: 1 2 string

16) What are Python namespaces? Why are they used?
Ans: A namespace in Python ensures that object names in a program are unique and can be used without any conflict. Python implements these namespaces as dictionaries with 'name as key' mapped to a corresponding 'object as value'. This allows for multiple namespaces to use the same name and map it to a separate object. A few examples of namespaces are as follows:

Local Namespace includes local names inside a function. the namespace is temporarily created for a function call and gets cleared when the function returns.
Global Namespace includes names from various imported packages/ modules that are being used in the current project. This namespace is created when the package is imported in the script and lasts until the execution of the script.
Built-in Namespace includes built-in functions of core Python and built-in names for various types of exceptions.
The lifecycle of a namespace depends upon the scope of objects they are mapped to. If the scope of an object ends, the lifecycle of that namespace comes to an end. Hence, it isn't possible to access inner namespace objects from an outer namespace.

17) What are Dict and List comprehensions?
Ans: Python comprehensions, like decorators, are syntactic sugar constructs that help build altered and filtered lists, dictionaries, or sets from a given list, dictionary, or set. Using comprehensions saves a lot of time and code that might be considerably more verbose (containing more lines of code). Let's check out some examples, where comprehensions can be truly beneficial:

Performing mathematical operations on the entire list
my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
squared_list = [x**2 for x in my_list]    # list comprehension
# output => [4 , 9 , 25 , 49 , 121]
squared_dict = {x:x**2 for x in my_list}    # dict comprehension
# output => {11: 121, 2: 4 , 3: 9 , 5: 25 , 7: 49}
Performing conditional filtering operations on the entire list
my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
squared_list = [x**2 for x in my_list if x%2 != 0]    # list comprehension
# output => [9 , 25 , 49 , 121]
squared_dict = {x:x**2 for x in my_list if x%2 != 0}    # dict comprehension
# output => {11: 121, 3: 9 , 5: 25 , 7: 49}
Combining multiple lists into one
Comprehensions allow for multiple iterators and hence, can be used to combine multiple lists into one. 

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [7, 8, 9]
[(x + y) for (x,y) in zip(a,b)]  # parallel iterators
# output => [8, 10, 12]
[(x,y) for x in a for y in b]    # nested iterators
# output => [(1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)] 
Flattening a multi-dimensional list
A similar approach of nested iterators (as above) can be applied to flatten a multi-dimensional list or work upon its inner elements. 

my_list = [[10,20,30],[40,50,60],[70,80,90]]
flattened = [x for temp in my_list for x in temp]
# output => [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

18) What is lambda in Python? Why is it used?
Ans: Lambda is an anonymous function in Python, that can accept any number of arguments, but can only have a single expression. It is generally used in situations requiring an anonymous function for a short time period. Lambda functions can be used in either of the two ways:

Assigning lambda functions to a variable:
mul = lambda a, b : a * b
print(mul(2, 5))    # output => 10
Wrapping lambda functions inside another function:
def myWrapper(n):
 return lambda a : a * n
mulFive = myWrapper(5)
print(mulFive(2)) 
Output => 10

19)What is the difference between xrange and range in Python?
Ans: xrange() and range() are quite similar in terms of functionality. They both generate a sequence of integers, with the only difference that range() returns a Python list, whereas, xrange() returns an xrange object.

So how does that make a difference? It sure does, because unlike range(), xrange() doesn't generate a static list, it creates the value on the go. This technique is commonly used with an object-type generator and has been termed as "yielding".

Yielding is crucial in applications where memory is a constraint. Creating a static list as in range() can lead to a Memory Error in such conditions, while, xrange() can handle it optimally by using just enough memory for the generator (significantly less in comparison).

for i in xrange(10):    # numbers from o to 9
   print i       # output => 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
for i in xrange(1,10):    # numbers from 1 to 9
   print i       # output => 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
for i in xrange(1, 10, 2):    # skip by two for next
   print i       # output => 1 3 5 7 9
Note: xrange has been deprecated as of Python 3.x. Now range does exactly the same as what xrange used to do in Python 2.x, since it was way better to use xrange() than the original range() function in Python 2.x.

20)What is the use of help() and dir() functions?
Ans: help() function in Python is used to display the documentation of modules, classes, functions, keywords, etc. If no parameter is passed to the help() function, then an interactive help utility is launched on the console.
dir() function tries to return a valid list of attributes and methods of the object it is called upon. It behaves differently with different objects, as it aims to produce the most relevant data, rather than the complete information.

For Modules/Library objects, it returns a list of all attributes, contained in that module.
For Class Objects, it returns a list of all valid attributes and base attributes.
With no arguments passed, it returns a list of attributes in the current scope.
